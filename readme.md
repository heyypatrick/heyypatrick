### Wadup, I'm Pat! :wave:

I work as a full-stack web developer with hybrid mobile app development skills (app developer). I'm based in Legazpi, Philippines.

Since 2018, I started my career in web development building modern, efficient and modern user friendly interfaces. Also, I'm into development of hybrid mobile applications that utilizes Laravel as a back-end with an experience in deploying applications into their respective platforms like Apple App Store and Android Playstore.

### What I'm focusing on :nerd_face:

Currently improving my mobile app development skills with Angular, Ionic and Laravel as a back-end and front-end skill with Angular.<br />
